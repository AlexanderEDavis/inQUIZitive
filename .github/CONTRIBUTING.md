# Introduction

### Welcome!

First off, thank you for considering contributing to inQUIZitive!

### Project philosophy

inQUIZitive is meant to be a light and very simple quiz platoform to allow students to revise for their exams. The few features implemented focus on
GCSE Computer Science in the UK. We are looking at creating a way for other subjects to use it too.

- Only modern browsers are supported, feel free to use any JS features without any polyfill as soon as the latest version of the major browsers supports them.

### Roadmap

If you want to know more about the project direction or looking for something to work on, checkout the [roadmap](https://github.com/AlexanderEDavis/inQUIZitive#Roadmap)!
Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions.

# Ground Rules

### Code of conduct and guidelines

First of all, we expect everyone (contributors and maintainers alike) to respect the [Code of conduct](https://github.com/AlexanderEDavis/inQUIZitive/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is not a recommendation, it is mandatory.

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: `.gitignore`).
* Do not add unnecessary dependencies.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.

# Getting started

### Discuss about ideas

If you want to add a feature, it's often best to talk about it before starting working on it and submitting a pull request. It's not mandatory at all, but
feel free to open an issue to present your idea.

### How to submit a contribution

The general process to submit a contribution is as follow:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Make sure to fill the [pull request description](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) properly.

### Happy coding :metal:
