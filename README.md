# Teachers Info
To create a quiz using the inQUIZitive framework, download the exe file and run it. This will allow you to create your quiz. Once the program has finished running, there will be a html file in the folder the exe file is. Upload that HTML file to the hosting of your choice or copy the contents of the file and embed it into your existing website.
